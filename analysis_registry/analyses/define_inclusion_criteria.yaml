description: >
  Working from inclusion_subjects_120426.csv, the notebook in this directory
  generates an inclusion (DD_Kable/subject_lists/initial_qa_pass_subjects_runs.csv)
  and exclusion file (DD_Kable/subject_lists/initial_qa_fail_subjects_runs_reasons.csv).
  The inclusion criteria are defined in the notebook and these are the subjects
  and runs that should be included in time series analysis.

  Omit a run that has >10% missingness, <10% or >90% choseAccept and/or no data in csv.  
  Omit a subject if they have fewer than 2 good runs out of 4.
