conclusion: "No nonsteady state scans detected in the BOLD data."
notes: >
  Using the non_steady_state_outlier columns of the fmriprep confound output files, I checked how many nonstead state
  scans occurred for each subject/run and found that it wasn't common and typically if a scan was flagged it was only the first TR.  
  Of the ~420 runs only around 50-60 had any TRs flagged.  Figures summarize findings in notebook.
