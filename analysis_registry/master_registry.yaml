  description: 'Working from inclusion_subjects_120426.csv, the notebook in this directory
    generates an inclusion (DD_Kable/subject_lists/initial_qa_pass_subjects_runs.csv)
    and exclusion file (DD_Kable/subject_lists/initial_qa_fail_subjects_runs_reasons.csv).
    The inclusion criteria are defined in the notebook and these are the subjects
    and runs that should be included in time series analysis.
