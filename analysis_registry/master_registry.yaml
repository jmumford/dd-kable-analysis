  conclusion: No nonsteady state scans detected in the BOLD data.
  notes: 'Using the non_steady_state_outlier columns of the fmriprep confound output
    files, I checked how many nonstead state scans occurred for each subject/run and
    found that it wasn''t common and typically if a scan was flagged it was only the
    first TR.   Of the ~420 runs only around 50-60 had any TRs flagged.  Figures summarize
    findings in notebook.
